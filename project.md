# Introduction:

The evolution of social media is one of the most significant social shifts of the 21st century in terms of technology and society. What started as simple digital communication channels in the early 2000s has evolved into a global ecosystem that has a profound impact on culture, politics, business, and human interaction, as well as having a huge impact on our modern world. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have transformed how people communicate, express themselves, build communities, and consume information. This transformation reflects rapid advances in computing and technology, as well as changes in human behavior as users.

Today, social media is not just an additional digital space; it is literally woven into our reality. In 2025, social media will be the primary platform for consuming and creating content, which in turn can shape market trends, influence political outcomes, and even define who we see ourselves as. However, this deep integration is not without its drawbacks. With the advent of social media, an abundance of information is now available to everyone. Therefore, in today's world, it is essential to be able to filter it and avoid falling for obvious fakes. Today, we need to develop digital intelligence that will help us feel confident in the digital space.

The complexity and scale of social media’s influence make it essential to examine its development from multiple angles. Understanding how these platforms emerged, evolved, and integrated into different aspects of daily life provides valuable insight into both their potential and their risks. By exploring the technological, cultural, and economic factors that shaped social media, this study aims to build a clearer picture of its role in the modern world. Rather than focusing on a single narrative, the goal is to establish a broad foundation that highlights key turning points, recurring patterns, and the wider implications of this digital transformation. This contextual overview will support deeper analysis throughout the project, regardless of the specific perspectives or approaches applied in subsequent sections.
