# Introduction:

The evolution of social media is one of the most significant social shifts of the 21st century in terms of technology and society. What started as simple digital communication channels in the early 2000s has evolved into a global ecosystem that has a profound impact on culture, politics, business, and human interaction, as well as having a huge impact on our modern world. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have transformed how people communicate, express themselves, build communities, and consume information. This transformation reflects rapid advances in computing and technology, as well as changes in human behavior as users.

Today, social media is not just an additional digital space; it is literally woven into our reality. In 2025, social media will be the primary platform for consuming and creating content, which in turn can shape market trends, influence political outcomes, and even define who we see ourselves as. However, this deep integration is not without its drawbacks. With the advent of social media, an abundance of information is now available to everyone. Therefore, in today's world, it is essential to be able to filter it and avoid falling for obvious fakes. Today, we need to develop digital intelligence that will help us feel confident in the digital space.

The complexity and scale of social media’s influence make it essential to examine its development from multiple angles. Understanding how these platforms emerged, evolved, and integrated into different aspects of daily life provides valuable insight into both their potential and their risks. By exploring the technological, cultural, and economic factors that shaped social media, this study aims to build a clearer picture of its role in the modern world. Rather than focusing on a single narrative, the goal is to establish a broad foundation that highlights key turning points, recurring patterns, and the wider implications of this digital transformation. This contextual overview will support deeper analysis throughout the project, regardless of the specific perspectives or approaches applied in subsequent sections.

# Historical developments:

Milestone 1 – SixDegrees (1997 – 2001)

SixDegrees.com which was launched in 1997 by Andrew Weinreich is widely regarded as the first true social networking site. SixDegrees contained and introduced most of the features which would come to characterise social networking sites such as user profiles, friend lists, and a direct / private messaging system. In 1999, SixDegrees purchased and acquired by the company Youthstream media networks for about 120 – 125 million dollars. According to Sixdegrees, they had brought in more than three million users by the year 2000, however it ultimately collapsed in 2001 due to low revenue and limited internet adoption. SixDegrees may have been short lived, but it laid the groundwork for the future of social media.

Milestone 2 – Myspace and Friendster (2002 – 2003)

Friendster launched in 2002 by Jonathan Abrams as well as Myspace launched in 2003 by Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe were both one of the first social networking sites to gain mainstream traction. Friendster quickly grew and had over 3 million users in just a few months following its release. The platform included some of the same features as SixDegrees such as customisable user profiles and private messaging. Due to technical issues and lack of innovation, Friendster ultimately shut down in 2011. Myspace quickly became the largest social networking site, having 75.9 million unique monthly visitors by the year 2006. Myspace also had customisable user profiles and messaging, as well as a focus on personal expressions such as interests and music. Myspace’s popularity eventually declined due to competition from Facebook, but its influence still lives on in the way users use social networks to promote personal branding.

Milestone 3 – Facebook expansion (2004 – 2006)

In 2004, theFacebook was launched by Mark Zuckerburg, along with co-founders Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin as a networking site for Harvard students. Over the next few years, the site expanded to universities across the USA and to the public in 2006, and the name was changed from theFacebook to just Facebook. In 2008, Facebook became the largest social network site of its time and had surpassed Myspace in the number of users. Facebook also would roll out key features around this time which would not only shape Facebook, but also many future social media sites. The like button was introduced by Facebook as a way for users to interact with and show appreciation to posts, as well as the tagging feature which allowed users to directly mention someone in or under a post. Facebooks News feed which was released in 2006 forever changed the way people consumed and shared media and news and also paved the way for people becoming reliant on social media for their news and information.

Milestone 4 – Twitter and microblogging (2006)

In 2006, Twitter was launched by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass. Twitter pioneered microblogging and real time interaction by allowing users to share quick updates and thoughts, while keeping them short with their 140 character limit for tweets. Twitter introduced features such as hashtags and retweeting which made the platform useful for creating and organising communities, as well as spreading news and information. By the late 2000s, Twitter was a key tool used in politics, breaking news, celebrity culture, and protests, for example the Arab spring protests. Twitter has made a lasting impact on social media through the way it emphasises letting its users have a voice, as well as through the many features it introduced and popularised for social networking such as hashtags.

Milestone 5 – Instagram (2010)

Instagram was launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a video sharing social networking service. The app contained the core fundamentals that were established by its predecessors such as customisable user profiles, and it also allowed users to upload, edit, and share photos and videos to their followers emphasising its focus on visual media. In 2012, Instagram was acquired by Facebook for approximately 1 billion dollars in cash and stock which allowed the app to grow and develop even more as it was now backed by the already established Facebook. In the coming months / year’s Instagram would roll out more key features which made the app grow even more such as the video sharing feature, the ability to upload stories, and Instagram direct which made Instagram have a direct message feature like previous social media sites and apps. Instagram paved the way for social media becoming more content and visual media based and less text based and also influenced future social medias such as Tiktok which is almost fully video and visual media based.

Milestone 6 – Tiktok and short form content (2016)

Tiktok was initially launched as Douyin to the Chinese market in 2016 before launching to the international market as Tiktok in 2017. Tiktok was founded by the company Bytedance which was founded by Zhang Yiming. In 2017, Bytedance acquired another short form content app named Musical.ly for around 800 million dollars, and in 2018 Tiktok merged into the Musical.ly app. Tiktok allows its users to create short form content of any topic, most popular being educational, comedic, and challenge videos. In 2018 – 2019 Tiktoks popularity skyrocketed, with Tiktok surpassing 1 billion downloads in November of 2018. Tiktok uses algorithms and user data such as their liked content and watch times to predict what content the user will want to watch and engage with, this is what makes Tiktok so addictive. Tiktok has played a massive role in making short form content mainstream, and has also led to other apps such as Youtube, Snapchat, and Instagram all integrating their own short form content features.

# Viewpoint 1:

Social & Cultural Viewpoint  

The rise of social media has re-shaped not just how we communicate, but how we build our identity, culture, communities, and how we work together. Today, more than ever, social media plays a huge role in our social and cultural lives, the way I which we speak, belonging, a tool for activism, and global connection. 

One of the biggest changes is how we communicate. Social media platforms have opened the door to new ways of interaction. That consists of short messages, images, memes, emojis, and instant sharing. These ways of communications are different from our traditional way of communication, changing the pace, tone, and social norms of conversation. A recent study suggests, social media use across cultures affects how people balance social benefits and social embarrassment when engaging online; what counts as sociability or public engagement can vary depending on cultural background.  

Beyond language and communication style, social media has drastically changed the way we identify and our sense of belonging on social media. Through online communities, people can connect across physical boundaries, join subcultures, and find groups with shared values, including even if they are minorities or are spread out globally. This means that identity is no longer strictly tied to physical community, locality or traditional social structures. 

In addition, social media is a powerful tool for sharing and combining cultures. People from different countries and cultural backgrounds can share traditions, trends, fashion, music, and art, leading to a global cultural mixing. This often results in new hybrid cultural forms emerging like online slang, humor styles, fashion sense, culture mixed memes, and more. In some cases, social media helps preserve the forgotten or indigenous cultures, for example, migrants from a particular ethnic group can use social platforms to share, revive, or preserve their cultural heritage even when living far from home.  

A particularly important social role of social media is in community building, collective identity, and activism. Online platforms allow people to form groups around shared interests, beliefs, values, or causes whether social, political, cultural, or personal. These online communities can surpass physical locations, bringing together people who may never meet physically but share a common purpose or identity.  

This potential has turned social media into a modern public sphere. Social movements, protests, and activism increasingly emerge or are supported online. Digital activism lowers barriers for participation, gives a voice to excluded or dispersed groups, and spreads awareness quickly. For example, recent research shows how online platforms help form collective identity and unity among participants of movements, even when they are physically distant.  

At the same time, this cultural and social shift has downsides. One challenge is the rise of echo chambers and polarized communities. Because people often interact with others who share similar beliefs or backgrounds and may unfollow or block those who don’t; social media can lead to segregated and one sided communities. This can reduce exposure to diverse perspectives snd opinions, reinforcing pre-existing beliefs and biases.  

Additionally, while online communities can support underrepresented or minority identities, social media culture can also lead to superficiality, social comparison and identity pressure. Users often create an idealized versions of themselves through photos, highlight reels, or selective sharing, which can create unrealistic standards. Watching others’ filtered lives can affect self-esteem, mental health, and sense of worth. This aspect of social media culture is widely discussed among critics and researchers. 

Another cultural shift is how language and communication style evolve quickly on social media. New slang, memes, abbreviations, hashtags, and communication shortcuts spread globally almost overnight through the likes of Tiktok, Instragram and X. These shapes of digital language influence how people write and speak even offline, especially with today’s gene z.  

At a societal level, social media has redefined our understanding of community and belonging. Instead of communities being defined by physical proximity (neighborhoods, towns, workplaces), many now define belonging by shared interests, values, identities, or causes online. This change blurs traditional social ways and expands who people can consider as community.  

Understanding these social and cultural impacts helps us see that social media is not just a technology, but it a transformative social phenomenon shaping culture, identity, and our society. 

 

 

# Viewpoint 2:

Social media has had one of the biggest impacts on culture and society in the modern world. While the technological side explains how platforms make money, the cultural side shows how they effect peoples lives . social media is not just a communication tool anymore, it became a part of people, It rewired people and changed how they connect, share ideas, or even see themselves differently, looking at it from this perspective it can aid us in understanding the positives and negatives of the digital era.
One of the clearest changes is how social media has redefined communication. Instead of waiting for a letter people can now just share their thoughts instantly with friends or strangers. Being able to share your thoughts with strangers made people use social media past communication and use it to set your identity just because everyone wants a perfect version of themselves to be displayed, Ultimately every public social media account was created for personal gain. Setting an identity online is an important point of pointing a community and activism, social media allows people to form groups around shared experiences, #BLM being a great example, BLM spread quickly online because of hashtags and viral posts have ordinary people a change to join something only able to be described as a global conversation. This shows how social media empowers communities and brings attention to important matters. Unlike the business side which focuses on profit, the cultural side highlights how platforms are used for social change, but this brings about an entirely new problem, Misinformation spreads just as quick or even faster as platforms often promote content that gets the most interactions. From a cultural perspective this is worrying as it makes it hard to know what reliable or not. Destroying trust in sources like newspapers.
Social media brings more challenges like harassment and cyberbullying. Connecting people fast does expose them to negative comments and harmful behaviour, being able to shape your own identity made this even worse as people can stay fully anonymous
And have no repercussions towards negative behaviour. Stuff like this harms peoples mental health. Some Study shows in the U.S 15% or so suicides are caused by comments online.
On the positive side social changed production and creativity. Platforms like Tiktok and Instagram allow everyone and anyone to make content and share it with millions. This got rid of the expectations between professionals and amateur creators. You can be the most advanced video editor, after uploading a literal masterpiece and getting a lot of views your video might be followed up by a 720p video of a dog running around chasing its tail. Influencers are a good example of the creativity and cultural shift as they set trends and gain huge followings, more often than traditional celebrities. This shows how cultural authority moved from big media companies to everyday people.
Finally social media has changed identity and self expression. People now shape themselves and express themselves through posts. Alot of kids now grow up and social media is their main influence changing how they act, perceive themselves and how they want to be seen. Which effects their self-esteem and belonging.

# Ethical Reflection:

Ethical Reflection on the Evolution of Social Media 

The fast growth of social media over the past two decades has changed how people interact, share culture, and communicate around the world. These platforms have also made it easier than ever to connect with others and access information. But they also raise profound ethical questions concerning privacy, mental health, misinformation, and social unity. Reflecting ethically on this evolution requires noticing both the empowering possibilities and the risks social media can bring, alongside suggesting ways for affective improvement. One of the most significant ethical benefits of social media is it helps everyone feel involved and supported. Social media has uplifted excluded groups and minorities to find community and a voice, and to bypass the usual people who control media and culture. Platforms let community-led activism, enabling movements such as #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo to gain visibility and mobilize global support. This action helps to promote social justice and pluralism, as well as boosting good ethical values and participation. 

 

However, the ethical challenges that we face by social media’s evolution is just as relevant. Privacy concerns are very important, the business gives many platforms to rely on extensive data collection and targeted advertising, often without users’ informed consent. This trading of personal data raises questions about autonomy and consent, as people may be unaware of how their digital footprints are getting exploited. In addition, social media’s design often make many people, both young and old addicted to the devices and the social media platforms that they use. This can greatly affect ones mental health, making them to have the likes, such as anxiety, depression, and lowered self-esteem. 

Misinformation and social division represent another ethical dilemma. Algorithms that prioritize engagement often increase sensationalist or false content, fostering echo chambers and social division. This can harm open and honest public discussion and democracy, showing that platforms have a responsibility to balance free speech with what’s good for society. The spread of harmful content, like hate speech and disinformation, makes traditional rules less effective and shows the need for new, fair ways to manage it. 


Improvements: 

To ethically improve the evolution of social media, a lot of things should be prioritized. First, transparency and user control over data must be enhanced. Platforms should make clear, accessible privacy settings and allow users meaningful choices about data use. Ethical design principles, sometimes called humane technology, should guide product development to reduce addictive features and promote digital well-being. 

Second, content should be monitored in a clear and fair way, including input from different groups, to reduce bias, protect free speech, and fight harmful misinformation. Collaboration between platforms, governments, and civil society can help standards that protect users without censorship. 

Finally, media literacy education is essential, especially for young people. Equipping people to critically evaluate online information can help us to navigate complicated online environments ethically and responsibly. Social media platforms can support this through partnerships with educators and by promoting credible sources. 

# Conclusion:
Social media has changed the way we talk to each other and how we get our information probably more than anything else in the last couple of decades. It started off small with sites like SixDegrees and MySpace and now it has turned into this huge online world that effects almost every part of everyday life. Apps like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok have not just changed how we stay in touch. They have ended up influencing politics, business, and overall culture in the world. 

But the fast growth of these platforms comes with problems. There is alot of information being shared all the time and a lot of it is not checked or verified. That makes it tough to tell what is true and what is misinformation. Because of that, people need strong digital literacy skills so they can think critically about what they are seeing online. Issues like mental health, privacy, and how social media affects society still need a lot more attention. 

Social media can definitely be used for good, but it has downsides that should not be ignored. What it becomes in the future depends on how we choose to use it now. As it keeps changing, we will have to learn how to deal with those changes. Its influence comes from its means of briging people together people, but also from the way we decide to use it. 

At the same time, social media has opened up a lot of opportunities for connection and creativity. People can share their art, ideas, and experiences with a huge audience, and they can find others who enjoy the same things. It has also helped support activism by giving people a way to speak up and organize when they dont have access to most platforms. Many important conversations and movements have come from online because regular people now have a place to be heard. 

But there are real risks too. Online harassment is common, and it can make people feel unsafe or afraid to express themselves. There is also pressure to look perfect or to fit in with whatever is popular at the moment. That can make people worry about their identity or feel like they are not good enough. As social media keeps changing, it is important for everyone to learn how to use it in a healthy way 

As well as that, social media opens up so many new ways for people around the world to communciate. Social communities have greatly changed the way we communicate with others on a daily basis. Whole cultures have been affected by the change in trends or taste of those online, which shows the great influence of social media. This cultural impact also had downsides, as those who do not share beliefs may exclude eachoter, possibly leading to some online segragation. As well as this, it may be hard for people to keep up with language changes due to social media trends like slang and abbreviations, possible leading to many misunderstandings.  

As a whole, social media has greatly changed the world and the culture in which everyone is within. We cannot say whether it is a strictly good or bad thing, but there has definitely been examples of both sides. There are actions that we can take in order to make the online sphere a better place, however, such as monitoring online presence more strictly while still allowing freedom for those who do not act out. We can also help prioritize giving a platform for those looking for help or assistance, as they may not hav anywhere else to look for it. At the same time, we should try to make it a more accepting place for all by monitering it a little bit more tightly to reduce conflict and have it a place where people can connect and share their thoughts without being put down.
