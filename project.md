# Introduction:

The evolution of social media is one of the most significant social shifts of the 21st century in terms of technology and society. What started as simple digital communication channels in the early 2000s has evolved into a global ecosystem that has a profound impact on culture, politics, business, and human interaction, as well as having a huge impact on our modern world. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have transformed how people communicate, express themselves, build communities, and consume information. This transformation reflects rapid advances in computing and technology, as well as changes in human behavior as users.

Today, social media is not just an additional digital space; it is literally woven into our reality. In 2025, social media will be the primary platform for consuming and creating content, which in turn can shape market trends, influence political outcomes, and even define who we see ourselves as. However, this deep integration is not without its drawbacks. With the advent of social media, an abundance of information is now available to everyone. Therefore, in today's world, it is essential to be able to filter it and avoid falling for obvious fakes. Today, we need to develop digital intelligence that will help us feel confident in the digital space.

The complexity and scale of social media’s influence make it essential to examine its development from multiple angles. Understanding how these platforms emerged, evolved, and integrated into different aspects of daily life provides valuable insight into both their potential and their risks. By exploring the technological, cultural, and economic factors that shaped social media, this study aims to build a clearer picture of its role in the modern world. Rather than focusing on a single narrative, the goal is to establish a broad foundation that highlights key turning points, recurring patterns, and the wider implications of this digital transformation. This contextual overview will support deeper analysis throughout the project, regardless of the specific perspectives or approaches applied in subsequent sections.


# Historical developments:

Milestone 1 – SixDegrees (1997 – 2001)

SixDegrees.com which was launched in 1997 by Andrew Weinreich is widely regarded as the first true social networking site. SixDegrees contained and introduced most of the features which would come to characterise social networking sites such as user profiles, friend lists, and a direct / private messaging system. In 1999, SixDegrees purchased and acquired by the company Youthstream media networks for about 120 – 125 million dollars. According to Sixdegrees, they had brought in more than three million users by the year 2000, however it ultimately collapsed in 2001 due to low revenue and limited internet adoption. SixDegrees may have been short lived, but it laid the groundwork for the future of social media.

Milestone 2 – Myspace and Friendster (2002 – 2003)

Friendster launched in 2002 by Jonathan Abrams as well as Myspace launched in 2003 by Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe were both one of the first social networking sites to gain mainstream traction. Friendster quickly grew and had over 3 million users in just a few months following its release. The platform included some of the same features as SixDegrees such as customisable user profiles and private messaging. Due to technical issues and lack of innovation, Friendster ultimately shut down in 2011. Myspace quickly became the largest social networking site, having 75.9 million unique monthly visitors by the year 2006. Myspace also had customisable user profiles and messaging, as well as a focus on personal expressions such as interests and music. Myspace’s popularity eventually declined due to competition from Facebook, but its influence still lives on in the way users use social networks to promote personal branding. 

Milestone 3 – Facebook expansion (2004 – 2006)

In 2004, theFacebook was launched by Mark Zuckerburg, along with co-founders Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin as a networking site for Harvard students. Over the next few years, the site expanded to universities across the USA and to the public in 2006, and the name was changed from theFacebook to just Facebook. In 2008, Facebook became the largest social network site of its time and had surpassed Myspace in the number of users. Facebook also would roll out key features around this time which would not only shape Facebook, but also many future social media sites. The like button was introduced by Facebook as a way for users to interact with and show appreciation to posts, as well as the tagging feature which allowed users to directly mention someone in or under a post. Facebooks News feed which was released in 2006 forever changed the way people consumed and shared media and news and also paved the way for people becoming reliant on social media for their news and information. 

Milestone 4 – Twitter and microblogging (2006)

In 2006, Twitter was launched by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass. Twitter pioneered microblogging and real time interaction by allowing users to share quick updates and thoughts, while keeping them short with their 140 character limit for tweets. Twitter introduced features such as hashtags and retweeting which made the platform useful for creating and organising communities, as well as spreading news and information. By the late 2000s, Twitter was a key tool used in politics, breaking news, celebrity culture, and protests, for example the Arab spring protests. Twitter has made a lasting impact on social media through the way it emphasises letting its users have a voice, as well as through the many features it introduced and popularised for social networking such as hashtags. 

Milestone 5 – Instagram (2010)

Instagram was launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a video sharing social networking service. The app contained the core fundamentals that were established by its predecessors such as customisable user profiles, and it also allowed users to upload, edit, and share photos and videos to their followers emphasising its focus on visual media. In 2012, Instagram was acquired by Facebook for approximately 1 billion dollars in cash and stock which allowed the app to grow and develop even more as it was now backed by the already established Facebook. In the coming months / year’s Instagram would roll out more key features which made the app grow even more such as the video sharing feature, the ability to upload stories, and Instagram direct which made Instagram have a direct message feature like previous social media sites and apps. Instagram paved the way for social media becoming more content and visual media based and less text based and also influenced future social medias such as Tiktok which is almost fully video and visual media based.

Milestone 6 – Tiktok and short form content (2016)

Tiktok was initially launched as Douyin to the Chinese market in 2016 before launching to the international market as Tiktok in 2017. Tiktok was founded by the company Bytedance which was founded by Zhang Yiming. In 2017, Bytedance acquired another short form content app named Musical.ly for around 800 million dollars, and in 2018 Tiktok merged into the Musical.ly app. Tiktok allows its users to create short form content of any topic, most popular being educational, comedic, and challenge videos. In 2018 – 2019 Tiktoks popularity skyrocketed, with Tiktok surpassing 1 billion downloads in November of 2018. Tiktok uses algorithms and user data such as their liked content and watch times to predict what content the user will want to watch and engage with, this is what makes Tiktok so addictive. Tiktok has played a massive role in making short form content mainstream, and has also led to other apps such as Youtube, Snapchat, and Instagram all integrating their own short form content features.
